        <h3>How are the free calls counted?</h3>
        <p>
          All extractions are counted, regardless one is triggered from our
          portal or through APIs.
        </p>
        <p>
          No matter you are on the free or basic plan, your first 100 calls are
          on us. However, if you are on free plan and have depleted all the free
          calls, upgrading will not grant you another 100 ones.

        <h3>What OCR providers can I pick?</h3>
        <p>
          At the moment, we support Tesseract, Google Vision and Azure Computer
          Vision. You don't have to subscribe to any of them, as we have taken
          care that part already.

        <h3>Do you save uploaded documents?</h3>
        <p>
          We only save the master form when it comes to form extraction. There
          is no master receipt for receipt extraction as models are already
          trained from our own data. All other documents uploaded are diposed
          once extraction is done.
